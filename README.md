# üöó Vehicle Movement on Map Web Application

This web application elegantly visualizes vehicle movement on a map using the **Leaflet** library. Users can effortlessly select two points on the map to calculate the shortest path, with a car marker animating along the route every 200ms. Additionally, the app offers route directions, a reset feature for recalculating routes, and a geolocation option to pinpoint your current location.
